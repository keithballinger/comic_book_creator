Title: Station Alpha-7

CHARACTERS: Commander Tanaka, Zax'thu, Dr. Ross, Light Being

PAGE ONE (6 Panels)

Panel 1
Majestic view of Space Station Alpha-7 orbiting a purple gas giant. The station is a massive ring structure with crystalline solar panels. Stars and nebulae visible in background.

CAPTION: Station Alpha-7. Humanity's furthest outpost. Population: 10,000 humans, 3,000 aliens.

Panel 2
Interior: Command center. COMMANDER YUKI TANAKA (40, Japanese, cybernetic eye) reviewing holographic displays showing station systems. Multiple floating screens with data.

COMMANDER TANAKA: Quantum core stable at 98.7%. Another quiet day in the void.

Panel 3
Warning lights suddenly flash red. Holographic displays show alert symbols.

SFX: ALERT! ALERT!

Panel 4
ZAX'THU (alien engineer, translucent blue skin, four arms, bioluminescent patches) rushes in, tentacle-like hair flowing with urgency.

ZAX'THU: Commander! Unknown vessel approaching. It's not responding to hails.

Panel 5
View screen shows a mysterious organic-looking ship, part biological, part mechanical. Tendrils of energy crackling around it.

COMMANDER TANAKA: That's no design in our database. Alien origin?

ZAX'THU: Not any species we know. It's... scanning us.

Panel 6
The alien ship fires a beam of strange energy at the station. Windows show the beam hitting the hull, creating rippling effects like water.

SFX: ZZZZAAAAPPPP!

COMMANDER TANAKA: All hands! Brace for impact!

PAGE TWO (6 Panels)

Panel 1
The beam passes through the shields harmlessly but station inhabitants begin floating. Gravity is failing. Tanaka and Zax'thu drift upward.

ZAX'THU: Fascinating! It's not attacking... it's altering our gravitational field!

Panel 2
Close-up of Tanaka's cybernetic eye analyzing data, streams of information reflected in the lens.

COMMANDER TANAKA: It's a message... encoded in gravitational waves.

Panel 3
DR. ELENA ROSS (30, floating, tablet in hand) and her assistant robot SIGMA-5 (spherical, multiple sensor eyes) work at a console, both floating.

DR. ROSS: Commander! I'm decoding it. It's... it's beautiful. Mathematical poetry.

SIGMA-5: Translation complete: 'We come seeking those who dream of stars.'

Panel 4
A holographic figure materializes in the command center - an ethereal being made of light and geometric patterns, neither solid nor wholly energy.

LIGHT BEING: Greetings, explorers. We are the Luminae. We have watched. You are ready.

Panel 5
The crew, still floating, looks on in awe. Through the viewports, more Luminae ships become visible, previously cloaked.

COMMANDER TANAKA: Ready? Ready for what?

Panel 6
The Luminae extends a hand made of pure light toward Tanaka. Behind it, a portal opens showing impossible vistas - cities of light, cosmic highways, civilizations beyond imagination.

LIGHT BEING: To join the Galactic Consciousness. Your species' isolation ends today.

CAPTION: First Contact. Everything changes.
