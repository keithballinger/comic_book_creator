Title: Morning Ritual

CHARACTERS: Mia, James

PAGE ONE (6 Panels)

Panel 1
Exterior of 'Bean There' coffee shop, early morning. Warm light spills from windows. MIA (28, messy bun, oversized sweater) approaches with a well-worn book under her arm.

Panel 2
Interior. Mia enters, bell chiming. JAMES (30, barista, friendly smile, already preparing her usual) waves from behind counter. Only two other customers, quiet atmosphere.

SFX: ding-a-ling

JAMES: The usual?

MIA: You know me too well.

Panel 3
Close-up of James's hands expertly making a latte, steam rising, creating a heart pattern in the foam.

JAMES: Rough week?

Panel 4
Mia at her usual corner table by the window, setting down her book (visible title: 'The Art of Being Present'). Shoulders relaxing, first genuine smile of the day.

MIA: You could say that. But this... this helps.

Panel 5
James brings over the latte and a surprise - a small cranberry scone with a candle. Mia's eyes widen in surprise.

JAMES: Happy birthday. On the house.

MIA: You remembered?

Panel 6
Wide shot of the coffee shop. Mia blowing out the candle, James heading back to counter. Other customer raising their coffee in a small toast. Morning light streaming through windows. A perfect, simple moment of human connection.

MIA (Thought Bubble): (Sometimes the smallest gestures mean everything.)
