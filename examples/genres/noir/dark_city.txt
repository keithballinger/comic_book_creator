Title: Dark City Blues

PAGE ONE (6 Panels)

Panel 1
Rain-soaked city street at night. Neon signs reflect in puddles. DETECTIVE SARAH MALONE (35, trench coat, fedora) stands under a streetlamp, cigarette smoke curling up.

CAPTION: This city... it gets under your skin like smoke in your lungs. You can never quite shake it clean.

Panel 2
Close-up of Sarah's face, half in shadow. Rain drops on her face mix with something that might be tears. Eyes focused on something off-panel.

CAPTION: Three years since Tommy died. Three years, and his ghost still walks these streets.

Panel 3
Sarah's hand reaching into coat pocket, pulling out a crumpled photograph.

SFX: rustle

Panel 4
The photograph: a younger Sarah with TOMMY, both smiling. The photo is water-damaged, creased.

CAPTION: We were going to get out. Leave this cesspool behind.

Panel 5
Bar entrance: 'The Blue Moon.' Neon sign flickering. Smoke drifting out the door.

CAPTION: But the city doesn't let go. It just takes and takes until there's nothing left.

Panel 6
Sarah enters the bar. Silhouettes of patrons visible through smoky atmosphere. Jazz music implied by musical notes in the air.

PAGE TWO (7 Panels)

Panel 1
Interior bar. Sarah at the bar, bourbon in hand. BARTENDER (50s, world-weary) cleaning a glass. Venetian blind shadows stripe across everything.

BARTENDER: Rough night, Detective?

SARAH: They're all rough nights, Eddie.

Panel 2
Close-up of bourbon swirling in glass.

CAPTION: I got a tip. About Tommy's killer.

Panel 3
A MYSTERIOUS FIGURE in the corner booth, face obscured by shadow and smoke. Only the glowing tip of a cigarette visible.

Panel 4
Sarah approaches the booth, hand subtly near her concealed gun. Tension in her posture.

CAPTION: In this city, information comes at a price. Usually blood.

Panel 5
The figure leans forward slightly, still in shadow. A manila envelope slides across the table. Sarah's reflection visible in the wet table surface.

MYSTERIOUS FIGURE: Some ghosts should stay buried, Detective.

SARAH: Not this one.

Panel 6
Sarah opens the envelope. Her eyes widen. The photograph inside partially visible - it's shocking but we don't see what.

SARAH (whispering): No... this can't be...

Panel 7
Final panel: Rain against the window, distorting the neon lights outside.

CAPTION: In this city, the dead don't rest. They just wait.

CAPTION: End of Part One
