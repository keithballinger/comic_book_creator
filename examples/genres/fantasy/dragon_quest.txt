COMIC SCRIPT: The Dragon's Quest
Written by: Example Author
Genre: Fantasy Adventure

PAGE ONE (5 Panels)

Panel 1
Wide establishing shot of a medieval fantasy village nestled in a valley. Smoke rises from chimneys, and mountains loom in the background. A dragon silhouette circles high above.

CAPTION: The village of Thornhaven had known peace for a hundred years...

Panel 2
Medium shot of the village square. ELARA, a young woman in leather armor with a bow across her back, stands before the VILLAGE ELDER, an old man with a long white beard and robes.

ELDER: The dragon demands tribute again, Elara. This time... it wants the Crystal of Dawn.

ELARA: But Elder, without the crystal, our crops will fail!

Panel 3
Close-up on Elara's determined face.

ELARA: I'll reason with the dragon. There must be another way.

ELDER (off-panel): Child, no one has ever returned from the dragon's lair...

Panel 4
Elara turns to leave, her cape billowing. Other VILLAGERS watch with worried expressions.

ELARA: Then I'll be the first.

VILLAGER 1: She's brave...

VILLAGER 2: Or foolish.

Panel 5
Wide shot of Elara walking toward the mountain path, the village behind her. The dragon's shadow passes over the ground.

CAPTION: And so began a quest that would change everything...

PAGE TWO (6 Panels)

Panel 1
Elara climbs a steep mountain path. Mist swirls around ancient stone ruins.

CAPTION: The journey to Dragon's Peak took three days...

Panel 2
Close-up of Elara's hand finding strange glowing runes carved into the rock.

ELARA (Thought Bubble): These runes... they're not warnings. They're... instructions?

Panel 3
Wide shot of Elara entering a massive cave mouth. Stalactites hang like fangs.

SFX: WHOOOOSH

Panel 4
Inside the cave, piles of gold and treasures gleam. But in the center sits the DRAGON, surprisingly small (horse-sized), reading a book with tiny spectacles.

DRAGON: Oh! A visitor! How delightful!

ELARA: You... you're reading?

Panel 5
Medium shot of the dragon looking sheepish, adjusting his spectacles.

DRAGON: Yes, well... the scary dragon thing is mostly an act. I'm actually QUITE reasonable. Tea?

Panel 6
Elara sits cross-legged across from the dragon, who pours tea from a comically small teapot.

ELARA: But... the tribute? The Crystal of Dawn?

DRAGON: Oh, that. Yes, I need it for my research. You see, I'm trying to restore magic to the land...

PAGE THREE (5 Panels)

Panel 1
The dragon shows Elara an ancient map with magical ley lines marked across it.

DRAGON: The crystal is the final piece. With it, I can reactivate the old magic networks. Your crops won't fail - they'll thrive!

ELARA: Why didn't you just explain this to us?

Panel 2
The dragon looks embarrassed, scratching his head with a claw.

DRAGON: Have you TRIED having a rational conversation while a mob is waving pitchforks at you?

ELARA: Fair point.

Panel 3
Elara stands, extending her hand to the dragon.

ELARA: Partnership? You get the crystal, but you work WITH the village, not against it.

DRAGON: Deal!

Panel 4
They shake hand-to-claw. Magic sparkles around their joined hands.

SFX: SPARKLE

Panel 5
Wide shot of Elara and the dragon flying back toward the village together, Elara riding on his back.

ELARA: They're never going to believe this...

DRAGON: Want to bet? I brought documentation!

CAPTION: And that's how Thornhaven became the first village to have a dragon as a research partner.
