PAGE TWO (5 Panels)

Panel 1
Sarah spins around. The room is empty, but objects have moved. Books are scattered, the mirror is cracked.

SARAH: This isn't real. You're not real!

Panel 2
Words appear on the fogged mirror, as if written by an invisible finger.

MIRROR TEXT: REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID

Panel 3
Sarah backs against the wall, clutching a silver locket.

SARAH: I didn't mean to... It was an accident!

VOICE (from everywhere): LIAR

Panel 4
The shadows in the room begin to coalesce into a human shape. Features slowly become visible - it's MARCUS, pale and dripping wet.

MARCUS: You left me to drown, Sarah. While you saved yourself.

Panel 5
Sarah falls to her knees, tears streaming.

SARAH: I tried! The current was too strong! I TRIED!

MARCUS: Not... hard... enough...

PAGE THREE (4 Panels)

Panel 1
Marcus reaches out with a ghostly hand toward Sarah. His fingers are inches from her face.

MARCUS: Join me, Sarah. It's so cold alone...

Panel 2
Sarah suddenly stands, resolute. She holds up the locket - inside is a photo of her and Marcus, happy.

SARAH: No. You wouldn't want this. The real Marcus would forgive me.

Panel 3
The apparition flickers, its expression changing from anger to sadness.

MARCUS: Sarah... I... I do forgive you.

SARAH: Then rest, my love. Please... rest.

Panel 4
Wide shot of the room. Sarah stands alone, morning light breaking through the windows. The storm has passed. On the floor lies a puddle of water where Marcus stood.

CAPTION: Some ghosts we carry are of our own making. And sometimes, forgiveness must come from within.
