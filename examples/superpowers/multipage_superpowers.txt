Title: Superpowers

PAGE 1 (4 Panels)

Panel 1
Setting: A slightly messy kid's bedroom. KEITH (a boy of about 10, with a wild mop of curly hair and glasses) is slumped over his desk, looking bored. A blank piece of paper and some pencils are scattered in front of him. A single, sad-looking drawing of a stick figure is on the paper.

Caption: Keith had a million stories in his head... but getting them onto paper was impossible.

Keith (Thought Bubble): Ugh. My hands just can't draw what's in my brain!

Panel 2
Setting: Same room, but now Keith is holding a tablet. His eyes are wide with excitement. On the tablet screen, we can see the interface of an app called "COMIC BOOK CREATOR," showing templates, character models, and speech bubble options.

Caption: Then, he discovered a new tool.

SFX (from tablet): Bloop!

Keith (whispering): Whoa... what's this?

Panel 3
Setting: Close-up on Keith, who is now completely absorbed in the tablet. His face is illuminated by the screen's glow, and he has a huge, focused grin. His fingers are a blur as they tap, drag, and swipe across the screen. We see glimpses of a cool-looking superhero character taking shape on the tablet.

Caption: Suddenly, the stories started to flow...

SFX: TAP! TAP! SWIPE! DRAG! FWOOSH!

Panel 4
Setting: Keith is proudly holding up his tablet to his MOM. On the screen is a finished, vibrant comic book cover featuring his superhero, "CAPTAIN KEITH," flying over a city. Mom looks amazed and impressed. Keith is beaming, looking like a hero himself.

Mom: This is amazing! You made a whole comic book!
