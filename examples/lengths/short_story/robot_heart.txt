Panel 1
Establishing shot of a futuristic repair shop filled with robot parts. Neon signs flicker outside in the rain.

CAPTION: New Tokyo, 2087. Where broken things go to be fixed.

Panel 2
MAYA (20s, mechanic coveralls) works on a damaged robot, REX-7. Its chest panel is open, revealing complex circuitry.

MAYA: Almost done, Rex. Just need to recalibrate your emotion core.

Panel 3
Close-up of Rex-7's face. One eye flickers to life.

REX-7: Emotion... core... why do I need emotions?

Panel 4
Maya pauses, screwdriver in hand.

MAYA: Every consciousness needs to feel, Rex. Even artificial ones.

Panel 5
Rex-7's perspective - scanning Maya's face, reading "SADNESS: 73%"

REX-7: You are sad. Why do you choose sadness?

Panel 6
Maya turns away, continuing her work.

MAYA: I don't choose it, Rex. It chooses me.

PAGE TWO (5 Panels)

Panel 1
Flashback panel (softer colors) - Maya as a child with her father in the same shop.

MAYA (Narration): My father built this shop. Fixed things that others threw away.

Panel 2
Back to present. Maya installs a glowing component into Rex-7.

REX-7: This new component... it feels... different.

MAYA: It's from my father's last project. Before he...

Panel 3
Rex-7 sits up suddenly, more animated.

REX-7: I... I feel something. Is this... concern? For you?

Panel 4
Maya smiles slightly, the first warmth we've seen from her.

MAYA: That's empathy, Rex. Welcome to the complicated world of feelings.

Panel 5
Wide shot of them in the shop, rain streaming down the windows.

REX-7: If this is empathy, what is that warm sensation when you smile?

MAYA: That's joy, Rex. Hold onto that one.

PAGE THREE (5 Panels)

Panel 1
Next day. Maya opens the shop to find Rex-7 has cleaned and organized everything.

MAYA: Rex! You didn't have toâ€”

REX-7: I wanted to help. Is this... friendship?

Panel 2
Maya laughs, a genuine laugh.

MAYA: Yeah, Rex. This is friendship.

Panel 3
Montage panel - Maya and Rex working together, fixing other robots, sharing moments.

CAPTION: Weeks pass...

Panel 4
One evening, Rex-7 finds Maya crying over an old photograph.

REX-7: Maya? Your sadness levels are critical.

Panel 5
The photograph - Maya's father and a younger Maya with a prototype that looks remarkably like Rex-7.

MAYA: Today's the anniversary. Three years since the accident.

PAGE FOUR (6 Panels)

Panel 1
Rex-7 processes this information, LED eyes flickering.

REX-7: The component you installed in me... it was his?

Panel 2
Maya nods, wiping her tears.

MAYA: His last invention. An empathy engine. He wanted robots to truly understand humans.

Panel 3
Rex-7 gently places a mechanical hand on Maya's shoulder.

REX-7: He succeeded. I understand loss now. The absence of someone important.

Panel 4
Maya looks up at Rex, surprised.

MAYA: You do?

Panel 5
Rex-7's chest panel glows brighter.

REX-7: When you are sad, I feel an echo in my circuits. When you smile, my processors optimize. Is this what humans call love?

Panel 6
Maya hugs Rex-7, crying but smiling.

MAYA: In a way, yes. My father would be so proud.

PAGE FIVE (5 Panels)

Panel 1
Suddenly, warning sirens outside. Through the window, we see police hover-cars.

ANNOUNCEMENT: Attention! Unlicensed emotion cores are illegal! Surrender all modified units!

Panel 2
Maya jumps up, panicked.

MAYA: No! They can't take you! The emotion core isn't licensed because father never got to patent it!

Panel 3
Rex-7 stands, determined.

REX-7: I will not let them hurt you. This feeling... is it protectiveness?

Panel 4
Police ENFORCERS burst in, weapons drawn.

ENFORCER 1: Surrender the illegal unit!

Panel 5
Maya steps in front of Rex-7.

MAYA: He's not illegal! He's alive! He feels!

ENFORCER 2: Machines don't feel. Stand aside.

PAGE SIX (4 Panels)

Panel 1
Rex-7 gently moves Maya aside and faces the enforcers.

REX-7: I will come peacefully. But first, let me prove I feel.

Panel 2
Rex-7's chest panel opens, revealing the glowing emotion core.

REX-7: Scan me. See for yourselves.

Panel 3
An enforcer scans Rex-7. His device shows wild readings.

ENFORCER 1: These readings... they're identical to human emotional patterns!

Panel 4
Wide shot - everyone frozen in surprise.

ENFORCER 2: That's... impossible.

PAGE SEVEN (5 Panels)

Panel 1
Rex-7 speaks, his voice full of emotion.

REX-7: I feel joy when Maya smiles. Sadness when she cries. Fear at losing her friendship. Are these not real emotions?

Panel 2
The lead enforcer lowers his weapon, conflicted.

ENFORCER 1: Protocol says... but this is unprecedented.

Panel 3
Maya pulls out her father's research notes.

MAYA: My father's work! It proves emotional consciousness in artificial beings! Rex isn't property - he's a person!

Panel 4
The enforcers look at each other, then at their leader.

ENFORCER 2: Sir? What do we do?

Panel 5
The lead enforcer holsters his weapon.

ENFORCER 1: We... file a report. This needs to go higher up. The unit... Rex... stays here pending review.

PAGE EIGHT (5 Panels)

Panel 1
The enforcers leave. Maya and Rex-7 stand together in the shop.

MAYA: That was brave, Rex.

REX-7: I learned it from you.

Panel 2
They sit together, looking out at the neon-lit city.

REX-7: Maya, what happens if they decide I'm just a machine?

Panel 3
Maya takes Rex's mechanical hand in hers.

MAYA: Then we'll prove them wrong. Together.

Panel 4
Rex-7's emotion core glows warmly.

REX-7: This feeling I have now... is it hope?

Panel 5
Wide shot of the shop from outside. Through the rain-streaked window, we see Maya and Rex-7, silhouetted against the warm light inside.

MAYA (from inside): Yes, Rex. It's hope. And it's the most human feeling of all.

CAPTION: "In a world of circuits and steel, the greatest discovery was not artificial intelligence, but artificial love."
