BOARD MEMBER 1: Impressive...

Panel 3
The board members whisper among themselves, nodding.

BOARD MEMBER 2: We'll extend funding for six months.

HAYES: Congratulations, Jack.

Panel 4
Jack in his lab, staring at the quantum accelerator.

JACK (Thought Bubble): I did it. I saved the project. But how do I get out of the loop?

Panel 5
Jack begins taking notes, drawing diagrams.

JACK: If the field collapsed asymmetrically, then reversing the polarity might...

PAGE SEVEN (6 Panels) - The Revelation

Panel 1
Jack works through the night (though it's still the same day). Equations cover every surface.

CAPTION: Hour 18 of Day 1. Or is it still Day 1?

Panel 2
Sudden realization. Jack drops his pen.

JACK: No... it's not a time loop. It's worse.

Panel 3
Jack reviews security footage on his computer.

JACK: The accelerator didn't send me back in time...

Panel 4
On screen: Multiple Jacks in different parts of the lab simultaneously.

JACK: It's fracturing reality. Creating parallel versions...

Panel 5
Jack turns to see ANOTHER JACK standing in the doorway.

OTHER JACK: You figured it out too, huh?

Panel 6
A THIRD JACK appears.

THIRD JACK: We all did. Eventually.

JACK: How many of us are there?

PAGE EIGHT (5 Panels) - The Multiplication

Panel 1
Wide shot of the lab. DOZENS of Jacks, all at different stages of the day.

JACK PRIME: This is insane.

COFFEE-STAINED JACK: Tell me about it.

SUCCESSFUL JACK: At least I saved the funding.

Panel 2
The Jacks argue among themselves.

ANGRY JACK: One of us has to be the real one!

CALM JACK: Or we're all equally real.

PARANOID JACK: What if none of us are?

Panel 3
Jack Prime at a whiteboard, addressing the others.

JACK PRIME: Listen! Every loop creates a new fractured timeline. We're not replacing each other - we're accumulating!

Panel 2
Jack Prime confused.

JACK: Timeline Omega?

FUTURE JACK: The last possible timeline. Where this all leads if unchecked.

Panel 3
Future Jack shows a holographic display of branching timelines.

FUTURE JACK: Every decision creates a branch. The accelerator just made them all visible. Real.

Panel 4
Close-up on Jack's realization.

JACK: So I have to choose? Pick one timeline?

Panel 5
Future Jack shakes his head.

FUTURE JACK: No. You have to choose to accept them all. Or reject them all.

FUTURE JACK: Reality fragments permanently. Infinite Jacks, infinite worlds, chaos.

Panel 5
Jack determined.

JACK: And if I reject them all?

Panel 6
Future Jack begins to fade.

FUTURE JACK: Then you go back. To the moment before. With the knowledge of what could be.

PAGE FIFTEEN (5 Panels) - The Decision

Panel 1
Jack reaches out to stop Future Jack from fading.

JACK: Wait! Which did you choose?

Panel 2
Future Jack smiles sadly.

Jack at his laptop, typing furiously. Subject line: "Urgent: Quantum Accelerator Safety Concerns"

Panel 2
Jack printing out documents, equations, safety protocols.

Panel 3
Jack arrives at the lab at 7:30 AM. Hayes is already there, reading Jack's email.

HAYES: Jack? These calculations... you're saying the accelerator is dangerous?

Panel 4
Jack hands Hayes the printed documents.

JACK: Not dangerous, sir. Just... incomplete. We need more safeguards. More time.

Panel 5
Hayes studies the papers, then Jack.

HAYES: This is remarkably thorough. It's like you've... seen what could go wrong.

JACK: Something like that.

PAGE NINETEEN (6 Panels) - The Meeting (Redux)

Panel 1
Conference room. Jack presents to the board, but differently this time.

JACK: I'm requesting we delay human trials and focus on containment protocols.

Panel 2
Board members look skeptical.

BOARD MEMBER 1: Delay? Your previous reports said you were ready.

Panel 3
Jack shows them the safety data.

JACK: New calculations show potential for... unintended consequences. We need six more months.

Panel 4
The board deliberates.

BOARD MEMBER 2: Safety first, I suppose. But this is your last extension, Dr. Chen.

Panel 5
Hayes and Jack outside the conference room.

HAYES: That was unexpected. But smart. What changed your mind?

Panel 6
Jack looks back at the lab where the accelerator sits, dormant.

JACK: Let's just say I had a vivid dream about what could go wrong.

PAGE TWENTY (5 Panels) - The Alternative

Panel 1
Jack alone in the lab, looking at the quantum accelerator.

JACK (Thought Bubble): I could have had infinite possibilities. Infinite chances to get everything right.

Panel 2
Jack's hand hovers over the activation switch.

JACK (Thought Bubble): But that's not living. That's just... avoiding consequences.

Panel 3
Jack turns away from the machine, resolute.

Panel 4
Jack at his desk, working on safety protocols. The clock shows 5:00 PM.

COLLEAGUE (off-panel): Heading home, Jack?

JACK: In a bit. Just want to finish this section.

Panel 5
Wide shot of Jack working as the sun sets through the lab windows.

CAPTION: Some loops we create ourselves. The hardest choice is often to break them.

PAGE TWENTY-ONE (6 Panels) - Six Months Later

Panel 1
Caption: Six months later.

Jack and his team in protective gear, preparing for the first safe test.

HAYES: Are we ready, Dr. Chen?

Panel 2
Jack checks all systems.

JACK: Containment field stable. Quantum dampeners online. Yes, sir. We're ready.

Panel 3
The accelerator activates, but controlled, contained. Beautiful but safe.

SFX: HUMMMMMM

Panel 4
Success! The team celebrates. Data streams across monitors showing positive results.

TEAM MEMBER: It works! Localized temporal dilation achieved!

Panel 5
Hayes shakes Jack's hand.

HAYES: Congratulations, Dr. Chen. You've made history. Safely.

Panel 6
Jack smiles, but his eyes show the weight of knowledge.

JACK: Thank you, sir. Sometimes the best discoveries come from knowing what not to do.

PAGE TWENTY-TWO (3 Panels) - Epilogue

Panel 1
That night. Jack's apartment. He's writing in a journal.

JACK (Narration): "Personal Log. The experiment was a success. The timeline remains intact."

Panel 2
Close-up of the journal entry.

JACK (Narration): "I sometimes wonder about those other Jacks. Did they ever exist? Or were they just possibilities, shadows of choices unmade?"

Panel 3
Wide shot. Jack closes the journal and looks out his window at the city lights. In the reflection, for just a moment, we see multiple faint images of Jack - all the possibilities that could have been.

JACK (Narration): "I suppose I'll never know. And perhaps that's for the best. Some doors, once opened, can never truly be closed."
