# Location Reference Example - "The Secret Base"
# Demonstrates using location references for environmental consistency
# Shows same location from different angles maintaining consistency

title: "The Secret Base"
author: "Example Author"
genre: "superhero"
style: "detailed environments, atmospheric lighting, tech-heavy interiors"

# NOTE: This example assumes you have created location references for:
# - "Hero Headquarters" with angles: wide_interior, computer_console, entrance
# - "City Street" with angles: street_level, aerial_view
# Create these first using: python -m comic_creator reference create-location

# LOCATION REFERENCE USAGE NOTES:
# - Location names must match exactly with reference names
# - Different angles of same location maintain architectural consistency
# - Lighting and time of day can change while keeping structural elements
# - Reference system ensures buildings, room layouts, and landmarks stay consistent
# - Multiple characters can move through the same referenced location
# - Camera angles can vary while maintaining spatial relationships
