# Reference Image System - Task Breakdown

## General Development Guidance

### **Core Principles**
- **Use Python:** Implement all components using Python with standard project layout
- **Test-Driven Development:** Write tests before implementing each task
- **Build and Test:** Use `make build` and `make test` commands consistently

### **Post-Task Checklist**
1. Update `arch_reference_system.md` if any architectural changes were made
2. Mark the task as complete in `tasks_reference_system.md`
3. Document implementation notes and architectural decisions in `tasks_reference_system.md`
4. Update remaining tasks if architecture changes affected dependencies
5. Ensure `make build` and `make test` run successfully with no warnings
6. Run a linter and fix any issues, run tests and fix any issues
7. Commit changes with descriptive commit message following conventional commits
8. Don't include Claude as an author or coauthor

### **Code Quality Standards**
- **Testing:** Table-driven tests with subtests, >80% coverage, mock external dependencies
