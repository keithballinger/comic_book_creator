COMIC SCRIPT: Sleepy
Written by: Keith Ballinger
Length: Short Story (2 pages)
Genre: Slice of life

PAGE ONE (6 Panels)
Panel 1
Establishing shot of a bedroom. It's neat but impersonal. Futuristic, minimalist furniture. A large window shows a city skyline with flying vehicles. ARTHUR (49, grey beard, black mustache) is sleeping fitfully.

CAPTION: Today, 2087. Where the sleepy wake up.

Panel 2
Sudden, tight close-up on Arthur’s eyes snapping open. They are wide with terror. He’s drenched in sweat. The room is empty.

ARTHUR (thought bubble): Not again. Not tonight.

Panel 3
Arthur is out of bed, in his kitchen. He slams a nutrient paste packet onto the counter. He looks exhausted, with deep bags under his eyes. His hands are trembling slightly.

SFX: WHUMP

Panel 4
Day. Arthur is on a public transit vehicle, an automated sky-tram. His head is lolling, his eyes closing as he starts to drift off. Other passengers are alert, looking at data-streams in their augmented reality contact lenses.

SFX (from tram): <ding> Approaching Sector Gamma-7.

Panel 5
Close on Arthur's face. His head jerks up, catching himself just before falling fully asleep. A flash of panic crosses his face.

ARTHUR (whispering to himself): Stay awake. Just stay awake.

Panel 6
Night. Arthur is back in his apartment, standing in the doorway of his bedroom. He stares at the bed as if it were a tomb. On his nightstand is a small, glowing device labeled "SOMNEX-IV: Dream Regulator." It is unplugged.

CAPTION: But some of us are afraid to dream.

PAGE TWO (6 Panels)
Panel 1
Arthur sits on the edge of the bed, defeated. He’s too tired to fight it anymore. He doesn’t even look at the Somnex device. He just lies back, pulling the sheet up to his chin, his eyes wide open in the dark.

ARTHUR (thought bubble): Fine. Let it come.

Panel 2
Arthur’s POV. The room is blurry. He can’t move his arms or legs. A low, vibrating hum fills the air. The classic sensation of sleep paralysis.

SFX: HRRRMMMMMMMM...

Panel 3
A tall, shadowy FIGURE coalesces at the foot of his bed. It has no clear features, just a vaguely human shape made of shifting darkness. It leans over him, a crushing weight settling on his chest.

ARTHUR (thought bubble, strained): Here it is.

Panel 4
Tight shot on the FIGURE’s “face.” It’s still indistinct, but for the first time, it speaks. The voice is not demonic or monstrous. It’s quiet, hollow, and sounds hauntingly like a distorted version of Arthur's own.

SHADOW (dialogue, jagged balloon): Why did you leave me all alone?

Panel 5
Extreme close-up on Arthur’s eyes. The terror in them fades, replaced by a sudden, heartbreaking wave of understanding and grief. A single tear traces a path from the corner of his eye into his hair. He is still paralyzed, but his internal struggle has ceased.

ARTHUR (thought bubble): I’m sorry. I didn't know how to stay.

Panel 6
Morning. Sunlight streams into the bedroom. Arthur is asleep, truly and deeply asleep for the first time. His face is peaceful. The shadowy figure is gone. On the nightstand, Arthur’s hand rests near the unplugged Somnex device, beside a framed, old-fashioned photograph of a younger Arthur with a woman and a small child.

CAPTION: Today, 2087. Where the lonely finally rest.
