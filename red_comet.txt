Title: Red Comet of the Belt

PAGE ONE (6 PANELS)

Panel 1
Wide shot: A sleek, crimson Soviet starfighter drifts silently among jagged asteroids. The cockpit canopy gleams with distant sunlight. The insignia of a hammer and sickle stylized in neon runs along the fuselage.
CAPTION (NARRATION): 23rd Century. The Belt Patrol.
CAPTION (NARRATION): Pilot: Major Alexei Volkov. Codename: Red Comet.

Panel 2
Interior cockpit. Close on Volkov, grim, scarred, wearing a high-tech flight helmet adorned with Soviet emblems. His hands hover over holographic controls.
VOLKOV (thought): Too quiet. Even for this graveyard.

Panel 3
Sudden flash of light across the black void. A colossal alien battlestar cruiser emerges from behind an asteroid—spiked hull, glowing with bioluminescent veins, dwarfing the fighter.
VOLKOV (balloon): Чёрт… (Damn…)

Panel 4
The alien cruiser unleashes a swarm of smaller, insectoid fighter drones. Their thrusters spit eerie green plasma.
CAPTION (NARRATION): First contact protocol: do not fire… unless fired upon.

Panel 5
Volkov’s HUD lights up red—lock signals all over his display. Sweat beads on his temple.
VOLKOV (thought): So much for diplomacy.

Panel 6
Explosive energy lances from the alien ship, tearing through nearby asteroids. Shards scatter like shrapnel around Volkov’s starfighter.
SFX: KRA-KOOM!
VOLKOV (balloon): For the Motherworld…

PAGE TWO (6 PANELS)

Panel 1
Volkov slams the throttle. The starfighter roars forward, weaving between asteroids. Alien drones give chase.
SFX: VROOOOM!
CAPTION (NARRATION): One man. One ship. One Belt.

Panel 2
Close-up: Volkov’s thumb slams a weapons toggle. Panels light up with “PLASMA CANNONS – ARMED.”
VOLKOV (balloon): Let’s dance, insects.

Panel 3
Starfighter unleashes twin streams of crimson plasma bolts, vaporizing two drones in a fiery burst.
SFX: THWAAAM!
SFX: KZZZRRRCH!

Panel 4
Inside cockpit: the HUD projects a massive warning. “PRIMARY POWER: 42% … SHIELD FAILURE IMMINENT.” Volkov snarls, undeterred.
VOLKOV (balloon): Then I’ll fight with steel and fire.

Panel 5
Cinematic wide shot: Volkov’s tiny starfighter barrels straight toward the massive alien cruiser’s glowing central eye. Dozens of drones swarm, but asteroids crumble in the crossfire.
CAPTION (NARRATION): A Red Comet streaks toward the heart of the unknown.

Panel 6
Tight shot: Volkov’s determined face, reflected in the glass. A hint of a smile.
VOLKOV (balloon): History remembers the first strike.

CAPTION (NARRATION): To be continued…
